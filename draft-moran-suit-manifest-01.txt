                      draft-moran-suit-manifest-01

Abstract

   This specification describes the format of a manifest.  A manifest is
   a bundle of metadata about the firmware for an IoT device, where to
   find the firmware, the devices to which it applies, and cryptographic
   information protecting the manifest.

1.  Introduction

   A firmware update mechanism is an essential security feature for IoT
   devices to deal with vulnerabilities.  While the transport of
   firmware images to the devices themselves is important there are
   already various techniques available, such as the Lightweight
   Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) protocol offering device management of IoT
   devices.  Equally important is the inclusion of meta-data about the
   conveyed firmware image (in the form of a manifest) and the use of
   end-to-end security protection to detect modifications and

   (optionally) to make reverse engineering more difficult.  End-to-end
   security allows the author, who builds the firmware image, to be sure
   that no other party (including potential adversaries) installs
   firmware updates on IoT devices without adequate privileges.  This
   authorization process is ensured by the use of dedicated symmetric or
   asymmetric keys installed on the IoT device: for use cases where only
   integrity protection is required it is sufficient to install a trust
   anchor on the IoT device.  For confidentiality protected firmware
   images it is additionally required to install either one or multiple
   symmetric or asymmetric keys on the IoT device.  Starting security
   protection at the author is a risk mitigation technique so that
   firmware images and manifests can be stored on untrusted
   respositories.

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the high-level
   firmware update architecture [Architecture].

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   To describe the components of the manifest we use the terms
   structures and attributes.  The manifest has a hierarchical structure
   and top level components are called structures and the attributes are
   the components within them.

3.  Components

   The key components of a manifest are shown in Figure 1 and are
   explained in the sub-sections below.

                    Figure 1: Components of a Manifest.

3.1.  Manifest

   The Manifest structure is the top-level construct that ties all other
   structures together.  In addition to the structures explained in
   subsections below it contains

   -  a version number (in the 'manifestVersion' attribute)

   -  a textual description about the update, including the version /
      vendor / model of the device (in the 'text' attribute).  This
      information is optional.

   -  a timestamp indicating when the manifest was created (in the
      'timestamp' attribute).

   The following CDDL fragment defines the manifest.

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format            January 2018


   Manifest = [
       manifestVersion : uint,
       text : {* int => tstr } / nil,
       nonce : bstr,
       timestamp : uint,
       conditions: [ * condition ],
       directives: [ * directive ] / nil,
       aliases: [ * ResourceReference ] / nil,
       dependencies: [ * ResourceReference ] / nil,
       extensions: { * int => bstr } / nil,
       payloadInfo: ? PayloadInfo
   ]

   In the text section, positive integers define standard text fields,
   described in this draft.  Negative integers define application-
   specific text fields.

 +----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
 | Field ID | Description                                              |
 +----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
 |        1 | A text description of this manifest                      |
 |        2 | A text description of the payload                        |
 |        3 | A text representation of the target vendor name /        |
 |          | manufacturer name                                        |
 |        4 | A text representation of the target model number /       |
 |          | model name                                               |
 +----------+----------------------------------------------------------+

   Text fields are never used by the target.  They are for informational
   purposes only.

3.2.  PayloadInfo

   The PayloadInfo structure contains information about the firmware
   image:

   -  format: contains the firmware image type (such as rawBinary,
      hexLocationLengthData, ELF).  Format is an array of: an integer
      (positive for standard types, negative for application-specific
      types) and a bstr that encapsulates any information needed by the
      format processor, that is not included in the firmware image
      itself.

   -  size: offers information about the size of the firmware image in
      bytes.  If the size of the obtained firmware image differs from
      the size stated in the manifest then the obtained image MUST be
      consider corrupted.

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format            January 2018


   -  nonce: contains a (short) random value to ensure that a given
      manifest is unique.  This separates the function of the timestamp,
      which is provided for rollback protection, from the function of
      the nonce, which is for uniqueness.  Keeping these functions
      separate ensures that a number of edge cases are catered for, for
      example: the creation of manifests quickly enough that they have
      the same timestamp.

   -  storageIdentifier: indicates where the image should be placed on
      the device.  This value is useful, for example, when an IoT device
      contains multiple microcontrollers (MCUs) and the decision needs
      to be made to which MCU to send which firmware image.  Another
      example is when an IoT device contains both firmware and
      configuration and the configuration must be updated while the
      firmware remains the same.

   -  uris: a set of ranked references for where to find the payload.
      By using a ranking, the device can select which the preferred URIs
      are.  If several URIs have the same preference, then devices
      SHOULD select randomly from the available URIs of the same rank.
      URIs need not be a URL, a URN is acceptable if the target
      understands it.  The uri can allow a device to use a ranked search
      pattern to choose the best location to look for the payload in
      complex distribution scenarios, such as attempting to find the
      payload on a gateway device prior to looking on a fileserver.

   -  digestAlgorithm: This defines the type of digest used for all
      entries in the digests list.  The type must be a standard COSE MAC
      algorithm or a message digest algorithm (these are not yet defined
      in COSE).  An optional 'parameters' bstr is provided in case one
      of these algorithms requires additional configuration that would
      normally be present in the 'protected' or 'unprotected' fields of
      the COSE_Mac object.

   -  digests: This is a map of possible digests.  It is indexed by
      integer: positive for standardized digests and negative for
      application-specific digests.

   -  payload: a COSE_Encrypt object, a bstr, or nil.  Note that a
      COSE_Mac could be used instead of a bstr / nil, but this would be
      redundant since the whole structure is already authenticated.

   NOTE: digests needs some form of key derivation to prevent the need
   for multiple keys.  It is expected that the same key be used, with a
   KDF of some kind, to derive a key from the key used to sign the
   manifest in the case of COSE_Mac manifests.  Where manifests use
   COSE_Sign at the top level, it is expected that digests will use
   standard message digest algorithms instead of MAC algorithms.

   The following CDDL fragment defines the payload info:

   PayloadInfo = [
       format = [
           type: int,
           ? parameters : bstr
       ],
       size: uint,
       storageIdentifier: bstr,
       uris: [*[
           rank: int,
           uri: tstr
       ]] / nil,
       digestAlgorithm = [
           type : int,
           ? parameters: bstr
       ] / nil,
       digests = {* int => bstr} / nil,
       payload = COSE_Encrypt / bstr / nil
   ]

   Digests can contain several kinds of digest:

 +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
 | Digest ID | Description                                             |
 +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
 |         1 | raw payload digest: the digest of the payload with no   |
 |           | modification. This is the digest of the plaintext.      |
 |           | This data is redundant when an AEAD algo is used.       |
 |         2 | installed payload digest: the digest of the payload,    |
 |           | post-installation. This is most useful in differential  |
 |           | updates.                                                |
 |         3 | ciphertext digest: The digest of the ciphertext of the  |
 |           | payload. This is useful when compressed or differential |
 |           | updates are used, since it can be used to verify the    |
 |           | downloaded package prior to decryption.                 |
 |         4 | pre-image digest: The digest of the image that must     |
 |           | already be present in the device in order to install    |
 |           | the payload.            |
 +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+

   There are several ways that this format can reference a payload:

   1.  The payload can be contained by the COSE_Encrypt object.  In this
       case, no URIs are expected, since the payload is contained in
       COSE_Encrypt.





Moran, et al.            Expires August 2, 2018                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format            January 2018


   2.  The COSE_Encrypt object is present, but its 'ciphertext' is nil.
       This means that the ciphertext payload is delivered separately.
       In this case, at least one URI is expected in uris.

   3.  The payload is a bstr.  This encapsulates a plaintext payload.  A
       raw payload digest is redundant.  No URIs are expected.

   4.  The payload is a nil.  This means that the plaintext payload is
       delivered separately.  In this case, at least one URI is expected
       in uris.  At least one digest is expected in digests.

   Most importantly, however, the PayloadInfo structure contains a
   reference to the firmware image (in the 'reference' attribute) or the
   image is embedded inside the PayloadInfo structure (within the
   'integrated' attribute).  A referenced image first needs to be
   fetched by the device before the update can be applied.  The
   'reference' attribute contains a 'hash' and a 'uri' attribute: the
   value in the 'hash' attribute allows the device to determine whether
   it has already obtained this firmware image and, since it is included
   in the digitally signed manifest, it protects the firmware image
   against modifications.  The 'uri' attribute references the image.

   Encryption is handled by the COSE_Encrypt structure.  Most encryption
   modes are already supported via the COSE_Encrypt structure, only per-
   device pre-shared keys (or per-device ECDH derivation of pre-shared
   keys) needs to be described.  When using an encrypted image key,
   shared between many devices, the COSE_Encrypt recipients structure
   should be filled out as follows:

   / recipients / [
       [
           / protected / h'a1011820' / {
               \ alg \ 1:32 \ AES-CCM-64-128-128 \
           } / ,
           / unprotected / {
               / kid / 4:'<uri for key lookup>' /,
               / iv / 5:h'<7 bytes>'
           },
           / ciphertext / nil
       ]
   ]

                Figure 2: AES-CCM-64-128-128 COSE Example.

   This allows a manifest to direct a device to fetch keys from a
   particular location, identify them by name, or perform another fetch/
   lookup operation.  The exact method for key distribution is out of

   scope.  (However, an array of COSE_Encrypt objects, each containing a
   single key object, with a simple recipient object seems appropriate.)

   This mode is tailored to use cases where a single encrypted firmware
   image is transmitted to many IoT devices.

3.3.  Condition and Directive

   The Condition and the Directive structures together allow "If <...>
   Then <...>" rules to be expressed.

   It offers the following functionality:

   -  Apply an update immediately (Directive.applyImmediately)

   -  Apply an update only to devices that match the vendorId, classId,
      deviceId attributes

   -  Apply an update only if the device system time is before the time
      indicated in the Condition.lastApplicationTime.

   -  Wait to apply an update until the device system time is after an
      indicated time.

   The following CDDL fragment defines the structure of a condition:

   condition = [
       type : int,
       parameters : bstr
   ]
   directive = condition

   Some condition types are predefined:

 +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
 | Condition ID | Description                                          |
 +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
 |            1 | Vendor ID. parameters contains the 128-bit vendor ID |
 |              | to match.                                            |
 |            2 | Class ID. parameters contains the 128-bit device     |
 |              | class ID to match.                                   |
 |            3 | Device ID. parameters contains the 128-bit device ID |
 |              | to match.                                            |
 |            4 | Best Before. Do not apply the update after time.     |
 |              | parameters is serialized as an uint timestamp        |
 |              | encoded in the bstr.                                 |

 |              | this manifest.                                       |

   Application-specific conditions and directives MUST use negative
   identifiers.

3.4.  Dependencies and Aliases

   In some situations an IoT device may require more than a single
   firmware image.  To express the requirement that more than one image
   has to be installed on a device the dependencies structure is used,
   which is of type ResourceReference.

   The following CDDL fragment defines the ResourceReference:

   ResourceReference = [
       uri : tstr,
       digest : bstr
   ]

   Aliases are used to refer to alternative locations of firmware
   images.  This is useful in environments where organizations cache
   firmware images (and their corresponding manifests) on premise to
   avoid the need to fetch images from repositories maintained by the
   developer's organizations (such a device manufacturer or an OEM).

3.5.  Device Identification

   A device is identified by a combination of three identifiers:

   -  A vendor identifier

   -  A device class identifier

   -  A device identifier

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format            January 2018


3.5.1.  Vendor ID

   The vendor ID is a 128-bit number that conforms to RFC 4122, type 5.
   This number is used by the device to verify manifests.

   The Vendor ID should be derived from the manufacturer's domain name
   using the algorithm defined in Section 4.3 of RFC 4122.

   A vendor ID is typically compiled into a firmware image since it is
   static for the lifetime of the firmware.

3.5.2.  Device Class ID

   The device class is a 128-bit number that conforms to RFC 4122, type
   5.  This number is used by the client to verify manifests.  The
   Device Class ID SHOULD use the Vendor ID as the namespace, but the ID
   within the namespace can be arbitrary.

   A class ID is also typically compiled into a firmware image since it
   is static for the lifetime of the firmware.

3.5.3.  Device ID

   The device ID is also a 128-bit number that conforms to RFC 4122.
   The device ID can come from a variety of sources.  For example, a
   device may obtain this identifier during the manufacturing phase
   (together with other configuration information and manufacturer-
   provided credentials).  In this case, we recommend using RFC 4122,
   type 1, where the node ID is the factory tool ID, which provides
   traceability of a device back to the origin of manufacture.  A device
   ID can also come from on-device resources, such as device unique-ID
   registers or device identifiers in CPUs.  Our recommendation is to
   provide unique CPU resources to a generator function similar to the
   one used for the class_id.  In this example, the device_info may be a
   combination of several components, such as:

   -  MAC address

   -  Device unique identifier

   Where multiple sources of unique identity are available, they should
   all be provided to the UUID function, since it combines them to
   create a single, unique identifier.

3.6.  Authentication of Manifests

   At the top level, manifests are authenticated using either the
   COSE_Mac or COSE_Sign structures, depending on application.  The
   considerations that apply to encryption keys in PayloadInfo apply
   equally to the use of Mac keys in COSE_Mac.

3.7.  Minimum Feature Set

   Not all devices will support the full feature set described in this
   specification.  If features become complex enough, it may be
   necessary to report the features used by a manifest.  Since this is
   redundant information, it is excluded from this draft.

   At minimum, targets MUST support the following manifest fields:

   1.  manifestVersion, so that the target can tell which version of
       manifest is in use.

   2.  text (this is ignored by the target)

   3.  nonce (this is ignored by the target)

   4.  timestamp

   5.  conditions

   6.  payloadInfo

   A target attempting to parse a manifest that contains non-nil fields
   that it does not support SHALL report an error in validation.

   At minimum, targets MUST support the ONE of the following payload
   modes:

   1.  digestAlgorithm, digests, bstr

   2.  digestAlgorithm, digests, uris, nil payload

   3.  COSE_Encrypt, inline ciphertext

   4.  COSE_Encrypt, nil ciphertext

4.  Manifest CDDL Specification

   The following CDDL code describes the entire manifest format.

       dependencies: [ * ResourceReference ] / nil,
       extensions: { * int => bstr } / nil,
       payloadInfo: ? payloadInfo
   ]

   The manifest itself is encapsulated in either a COSE_Mac or a
   COSE_Sign block.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Editor's Note: A few registries would be good to allow easier
   allocation of new features.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document is about a manifest format describing and protecting
   firmware images and as such it is part of a larger solution for
   offering a standardized way of delivering firmware updates to IoT
   devices.  A more detailed discussion about security can be found in
   the architecture document [Architecture].
